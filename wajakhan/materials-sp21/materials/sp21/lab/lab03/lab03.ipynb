    "In this lab, you'll first see how to represent and manipulate another fundamental type of data: text.  A piece of text is called a *string* in Python. You'll also see how to work with *arrays* of data, such as all the numbers between 0 and 100 or all the words in the chapter of a book. Lastly, you'll create tables and practice analyzing them with your knowledge of table operations.\n",

    "**Deadline**: If you are not attending lab, you have to complete this lab and submit by Wednesday, 2/3 before 8:59 A.M. PST in order to receive lab credit. Otherwise, please attend the lab you are enrolled in, get checked off with your GSI or academic intern **AND** submit this assignment by the end of the lab section (with whatever progress you've made) to receive lab credit.\n",
