    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **California Police Scorecard** features data from 2016-2018 regarding police department performance and policies in all 58 California counties (with information about multiple police departments per county). We split the data into three datasets: **an arrests dataset, an accountability dataset, and a demographic dataset**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The **arrests data** (157 rows, 26 columns) quantifies police shootings, uses of force, arrests (with information about race) and homicides, budget, and more. The **accountability data** (157 rows, 17 columns) marks what policies are in place (1: yes, 0: no) for police departments to hold their police officers accountable. The **demographic data** (157 rows, 16 columns) provides race and economic information about the citizens in a police district to contextualize police behavior in their respective communities. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset has also recently expanded to include information about Sheriffs’ Departments, the operator of county jails, which has the same metrics used to evaluate police departments. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a quick glance of how each police department is performing, **Campaign Zero has rated the departments in three areas of policing: police violence, police accountability, and approach to policing**. They have averaged these scores to provide an **overall score** (the higher, the better) that summarizes the departments’ performance in those three areas. Notably, **the majority of police departments have received an ‘F’ grade**, indicating excess levels of lethal force, injured civilians, incidence of racial bias, over policing, complaints sustained, etc. You can read more about the methodology and formula used to compute the scores here: https://policescorecard.org/about. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, **we recommend exploring the Campaign Zero analysis - https://policescorecard.org/ - of the scorecard data to see what work has already been done and serve as inspiration for your own data project**. Campaign Zero’s mission is to end police brutality in America by implementing research-backed policy solutions. From Campaign Zero: ‘The scorecard is designed to help communities, researchers, police leaders and policy-makers take informed action to reduce police use of force and improve accountability and public safety in their jurisdictions.’ Furthermore, this is an opportunity to apply the skills you’ve learned in Data 8 to social justice topics if you’ve felt moved to tackle systemic racism and police brutality in America. \n",

    "1. What is the trend over time for police shootings?\n",

    "3. Is there a statistically significant difference in the distribution of drug arrests for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Whites, etc?\n",
