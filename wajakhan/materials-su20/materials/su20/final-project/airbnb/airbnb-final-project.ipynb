    "## Summary\n",
    ">Airbnb offers a platform to connect hosts with guests for short-term or long-term lodging accommodations. Compared to similar firms offering vacation rental services\n",
    "such as VRBO or HomeAway, Airbnb is the largest and most prominent, with more than 7 million listings worldwide and 2 million people staying in one of its listings\n",
    "per night in 2018. Since its founding in 2008, hosts on the platform have served more than 750 million guests, and the firm has grown at an exponential rate globally\n",
    "pre-COVID.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">The data presented are completely from web scraping the Airbnb website in June 2020 for random subset of listings in San Francisco. As a result, the data only contain\n",
    "information that a visitor to Airbnb’s site can see. This includes the `listings` table that records all Airbnb units and the `calendar` table that records the\n",
    "availabilities for the next 365 days and quoted price per night over the next year of each listing. What each table specifically describes will be gone over in the\n",
    "Data Description section below. Note that we do not observe Airbnb transactions or bookings, but only the dates that are available or unavailable through `calendar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">The primary identifier for each listing is the `listing_id` or `id` column (the column name changes depending on the title). Each ID uniquely determines a listing,\n",
    "and every listing only has 1 ID. You can visit each listing's URL on Airbnb by going to https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/YOUR_ID_HERE with the id to look up the listing\n",
    "on the airbnb website."

    "The dataset consists of many tables stored in the `data` folder. **You do not have use to all of the tables in your analysis.**\n",
    "1. `listings` provides information on 2000 Airbnb listings in San Francisco. Each row is a unique listing.\n",
    "2. `ratings` contains average ratings for the Airbnb listings across 6 categories and its overall rating. Guests who stay at an Airbnb are eligible to score a listing on each of the categories and on the overall score out of 5.\n",
    "3. `calendar` contains each listing's availability and price over the next year. This data is the same as the calendar that pops up when users try to select the dates of a reservation for a particular listing. For example, the first row means that the listing with ID 40138 was not available on June 8th, 2020. The price per night of this listing is \\\\$67. \n",

    "* `availability_X`: availability for the next X days (relative to the scraping date, June 8th, 2020)\n",
    "* `amenities`: a list of amenities provided by the listing. Note that each item is an iterable set\n",
