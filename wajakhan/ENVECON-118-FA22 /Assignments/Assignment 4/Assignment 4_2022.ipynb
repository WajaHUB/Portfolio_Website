    "Trees are able to absorb a lot of the CO2 in the atmosphere. Thus, a lot of policy attention has been focused on the role trees can play in slowing down the increase in CO2 levels. One potential avenue has been to reduce deforestation, by preventing forest owners from cutting down trees. In the context we study and many other contexts, tree cutting is a very lucrative activity (mostly from selling timber), but also provides firewood for fuel and cooking. People might resort to tree cutting as their main economic activity, or to provide them with extra income in case of an emergency. \n",

    "One paper by Jayachandran, de Laat, Lambin, Stanton, Audy and Thomas (2017) looks at a policy in Uganda, where farmers in different villages are enrolled into a randomized controlled trial and are offered cash  in exchange of not cutting down their trees (this type of intervention or policy is often called payment for ecosystem services or PES). However there is still debate over whether these are effective (especially cost-effective) policies for environmental conservation. (The paper is [Cash for carbon: A randomized trial of payments for ecosystem services to reduce deforestation](https://www-science-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/full/10.1126/science.aan0568#supplementary-materials) _Science_ Vol 357, Issue 6348.)\n",

One way to test whether coviarate $X$ is correlated with treatment status $T$, you can put `X~T` inside `t.test()`, just like you would for `lm()`. If you just want to print the t-stat or the p-value rather than the entire test output, you can call `$statistic` or `$p.value`, respectively. \n",

    "You can repeat this separately for each covariate, but if you want to be extra fancy you can use the `lapply()` function. `lapply()` is super useful for applying a function repeatedly over different variables. The way you would use it here is `lapply(X, function (x) FUN)` where `X` is the data frame of the variables you are interested in testing and `FUN` is the function you want to apply. One of the arguments of this function should be (small) `x`, which serves as a stand-in for the column of (big) `X` that you want to apply the function over. Finally, if you want to show the output as a single data frame (instead of a list), you can wrap all of this with `as.data.frame()`. With all of this information, you could theoretically produce a nice-ish table of p-values for the four tests you run using a single line of code. You are not required or expected to use this method, but it might come in handy if you find yourself having to work with larger datasets in the future."
