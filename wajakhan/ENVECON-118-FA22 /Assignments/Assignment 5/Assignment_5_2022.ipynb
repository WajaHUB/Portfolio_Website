    "# Exercise 1. The Effect of Broadband Internet on Employment - Difference-in-Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we are going to look at a paper studying the effects of access to broadband internet on employment outcomes (note that we are only giving you a subset of the data, so your results are not going to match the results in the paper). This paper answers a very policy-relevant question: does improving broadband access and affordability increase opportunities on the labor market for low-income households? There are large disparities in the US in adoption and access to home internet, most of it explained by income. Affordability is often cited as the main barrier to at-home internet, and lack of internet access at home may prevent low-income job seekers from accessing new job opportunities. According to the author, job seekers without broadband are 21 percent less likely to use online resources for job search and face other obstacles to employment that modern online tools may be suited to address. \n",
    "\n",
    "Zuo (2021) test whether this is true using a change of policy in 2012, where high-speed internet was offered at a very affordable price but only for eligible households (families whose children receive free or reduced-price lunch) in areas that were covered by Comcast. Zuo uses information on the specific internet provider, eligibility and labor market outcomes to study this question (he actually implements a difference-in difference-in differences strategy, similar to difference-in-difference but beyond the scope of this class). \n",
    "Pre-policy change observations are coded as 2011 and post-policy change observations are coded as 2012 in your data for the sake of simplicity. This data is then used to obtain a difference-in-differences estimate of the effect of broadband internet on employment. \n",

    "In this exercise, we will look at the effect of improving water pipes to prevent lead exposure in schools on students' school outcomes. Many school districts in California, particularly less wealthy school districts, have school infrastructures that are many decades old. These schools were built at a time where lead standards might not have been as stringent as they are now, exposing the students to potentially high levels of lead in walls or in drinking water. In 2017, the state of California started an initiative to test lead levels in all public K-12 schools in the state, and helping school districts replace their water pipes. We have data for these replacements for the years 2017-2019, with the number of replacements per year more or less increasing over the sample period. This data is combined with attendance data from all school districts in California over the same period to test the impact of reducing lead exposure through infrastructure upgrading on student health. Attendance is used to measure student health because students who are chronically ill are often absent from school. The full dataset is described in detail below.\n",

The omitted variable here would be that we didn't consider individual districts to be impacted different based on changing lead pipes to increase attendance, we made an assumption that they all would be the same but it turns out there is an omitted variable of poor district versus rich district or locations of district where the water might be less contaimined somehow."

Or another example would be what if something happened, where people moved a lot, for example during covid a lot of people started to move, so that would create a change in the district and its value because there are \"new\" people in the district which could change the economy for this given district or have stronger immune systems."
